# HIEnsembleHindcast - Ensemble CME modelling constrained by heliospheric imager observations.

## Introduction
This repository provides the analysis code and data used to investigate how Heliospheric Imager data can be used to constrain an ensemble hindcasts of CMEs using the HUXt model. This study is accepted for publication in AGU Advances.
